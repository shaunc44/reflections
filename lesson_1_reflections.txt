How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It helped me locate the type.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to older files would allow me to increase my debugging efficiency.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saving allows the user to select proper stopping points in the project, whereas auto save can save in the middle of a big change in the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For instance, in web design it takes multiple files to for one web page to function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the commit history, while git diff reveals the lines changes between to commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    It's comforting knowing that checkout allows you to revert back and forth between commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All of my programming and design projects!  Very exciting :)
