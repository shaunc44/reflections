When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you're working on a project that requires sharing data with others; also when you'd like to backup your data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manually pulling gives you greater control as to when and what changes are pulled to your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches occur in single repositories.
	Clones involve making an idential copy of a repository in your local machine, etc.
	Forks entail copying another GitHub repo to your GitHub account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Having the latest copy of the remote stored locally will enable you to continue working on the project while away from the office/team; for example, if you're traveling.
