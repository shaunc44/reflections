When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you're working on a project that requires sharing data with others; also when you'd like to backup your data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manually pulling gives you greater control as to when and what changes are pulled to your local repository.
